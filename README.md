# PIE: a Programmatic Incremental Build System in Rust

PIE is a Programmatic Incremental Build System, a hybrid incremental build system and incremental computation system.
With PIE, you _program_ your build scripts in Rust against the PIE API.
Then, PIE will correctly and incrementally execute your build script!

PIE is currently under development and has not been published to crates.io yet, but it has decent test coverage and is ready for experimental use.
A better README explaining the library is in the works.

If you want to learn more about Programmatic Incremental Build Systems, check out this programming tutorial: <https://gohla.github.io/pibs>.
It explains the concepts behind Programmatic Incremental Build Systems through implementation and experimentation.
